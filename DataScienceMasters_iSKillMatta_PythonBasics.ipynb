    "#### Things to know about strings in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Escaping characters: If you need to include a quote character within a string, you can escape it by preceding it with a backslash (\\). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### message = \"He said, \\\"Hello, how are you?\\\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw strings: If you need to include a backslash in a string and don't want it to be interpreted as an escape character, you can create a raw string by preceding the string with the letter r. Raw strings are useful when working with regular expressions and file paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### path = r\"C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiline strings: If you need to create a string that spans multiple lines, you can use triple quotes (either single quotes or double quotes) to create a multiline string. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### message = \"\"\"This is a\n",
    "multiline\n",
    "string\"\"\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode strings: In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, meaning that they can represent any character in the Unicode character set. This makes it easy to work with text in multiple languages. If you need to create a string that contains characters that are not part of the ASCII character set, you can use Unicode escape sequences to specify those characters. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### message = \"こんにちは\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting strings: You can use the format method to insert values into a string. The format method allows you to specify placeholders within the string, which are then replaced with values from the argument list. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#####\n",
    "name = \"John\"\n",
    "age = 30\n",
    "message = \"My name is {} and I am {} years old\".format(name, age)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "String indexing and slicing: Strings can be indexed and sliced just like lists. The index of the first character in a string is 0, and you can use negative index values to access characters from the end of the string. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "name = \"John Doe\"\n",
    "print(name[0]) # Output: J\n",
    "print(name[-1]) # Output: e\n",
    "print(name[1:4]) # Output: ohn\n"

    "### Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory. Variables are used to store values that can change during the execution of a program. A variable can be assigned a value using the assignment operator =. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable can change during the execution of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable naming conventions: In Python, variables can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They cannot start with a number and should not be one of the Python keywords. It's a common practice to use all lowercase letters with words separated by underscores for variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope of variables: Variables can have different scopes depending on where they are defined. For example, variables defined inside a function are local to that function and are not accessible outside of it. On the other hand, variables defined outside of any function are global and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability: In Python, some data types are mutable, meaning that their values can be changed, while others are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed once they are created. For example, lists and dictionaries are mutable, while strings and tuples are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global and nonlocal keywords: The global keyword can be used to specify that a variable is a global variable, even if it's being assigned inside a function. The nonlocal keyword can be used to specify that a variable is non-local to the current function, meaning that it's defined in the nearest enclosing function that's not a global function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collection: In Python, memory management is handled automatically, and objects that are no longer referenced by any variable are automatically cleaned up by the garbage collector. This means that you don't have to worry about freeing up memory yourself."

    "\n",
    "Dynamic typing is a type system used in some programming languages where the data type of a value is determined at runtime. In contrast, in statically-typed languages, the data type of a variable is determined at compile-time and must remain the same throughout the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dynamic typing, variables don't have to be explicitly declared with a specific data type, and the type of the value stored in a variable can change dynamically during runtime. This can allow for more flexible and versatile code, as well as faster development time. However, it can also make it harder to catch type errors and can result in unexpected behavior if the type of a variable changes in unexpected ways.\n",

    "## Tuple, Set and Dictionary\n",
    "In Python, there are several built-in data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data: tuple, set, and dictionary. Each of these data structures has its own advantages and disadvantages, and they are used in different scenarios depending on the problem you are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a comparison of the three:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple: A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements of any data type. Once you define a tuple, you cannot modify its contents. Tuples are typically used to store a small number of related values, where each value has a specific meaning. For example, you can use a tuple to represent a point in a two-dimensional space with (x, y).\n",
    "\n",
    "Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Unlike a list or a tuple, sets do not allow duplicates, and sets do not maintain the order of the elements. Sets are often used when you need to perform set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference. For example, you can use a set to represent a collection of unique numbers, such as prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary: A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are often used to represent a collection of related values, where each key is a label for a specific value. For example, you can use a dictionary to represent a collection of countries and their capitals, where the country name is the key and the capital is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, use a tuple if you need an ordered, immutable collection of elements, use a set if you need an unordered collection of unique elements, and use a dictionary if you need an unordered collection of key-value pairs."

    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can also include conditions, so you can select only specific elements from the list based on certain criteria. Here's an example:\n",

When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over, but unlike a normal function, it does not return a value, instead it generates a series of values, one at a time, on-the-fly.\n",

When the function is next called, the execution resumes from where it left off, and continues until the next yield statement. The function can be called multiple times, and each time it will start producing the values from where it left off. This makes generator functions very efficient for producing a large number of values, as they only generate the values as they are requested, rather than generating all of the values upfront and returning them as a list."

    "The primary difference between using the yield statement and returning a list of values is the way the values are generated and consumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function contains a yield statement, it becomes a generator function. A generator function is used to generate values one by one, instead of generating all the values at once and returning them as a list. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be used to iterate over the values produced by the generator function one by one. The generator function only generates values when they are requested through the generator object, so it can generate an arbitrarily large number of values without consuming a lot of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, when a function returns a list of values, it generates all the values at once and returns them as a list. The entire list of values is stored in memory, so if the list is large, it can consume a lot of memory. In addition, the entire list of values must be generated before any values can be consumed, which can be inefficient if the list is large and only a few values are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using the yield statement are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory efficiency: Since the generator function generates values one by one, it only generates the values that are needed, and doesn't consume a lot of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time efficiency: Since the generator function only generates values when they are requested, it can start producing values as soon as possible, even before the entire list of values has been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Generators are a simple and straightforward way to produce a series of values, without having to manage the memory and performance issues associated with returning a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you should use the yield statement when you need to generate an arbitrarily large series of values, and you don't need to generate the entire series of values at once. If you only need a few values from the series, or if you need to generate a small series of values, it may be simpler to return a list of values."

    "For example, when i is 0, the lambda function returns '*' because 0+1 = 1. When i is 1, the lambda function returns '**' because 1+1 = 2. Similarly, when i is 2, the lambda function returns '***' because 2+1 = 3, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map function returns an iterator that generates the strings of '*' characters for each element of the range. However, since we want to store these strings in a list, we need to convert the iterator to a list using the list function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting list of strings represents the rows of the right-angled triangle pattern, with the first element of the list representing the first row, the second element representing the second row, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign this list of strings to the variable rows, which we can then use to print the right-angled triangle pattern.\n",

    "The lambda function takes an integer i as input and returns a string of '*' characters of length i+1. The syntax for a lambda function is lambda <input>: <expression>. In this case, our lambda function takes i as its input and returns the expression '*' * (i+1) as its output.\n",

    "### OOPS Concepts : Object-Oriented Programming System \n",
    "\n",
    "What is object-oriented programming?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise known as data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being who is described by properties like name and address, to small computer programs, such as widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the structure of object-oriented programming?\n",
    "The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity. When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.  "

    "##### What are the main principles of OOP?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is based on the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Encapsulation*** . This principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes. They are only able to call a list of public functions or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.   \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "***Abstraction***. Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. The derived class can have its functionality extended. This concept can help developers more easily make additional changes or additions over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Inheritance*** Classes can reuse code from other classes. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Polymorphism.*** Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code. A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class. Polymorphism allows different types of objects to pass through the same interface."

    "In the above code, we have a class called MyClass which has three different types of methods: normal instance method, static method, and class method. Here's a detailed explanation of each of these methods:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Instance Method: This is a regular method that we define in a class. It takes self as its first parameter, which refers to the instance of the class that called the method. An instance method can access both instance variables and class variables. An instance method is used when we need to modify the state of the object. For example, instance_method is an instance method that can access both instance and class variables.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Static Method: This is a special type of method that does not take self as its first parameter. Instead, it is decorated with the @staticmethod decorator. A static method can access class variables but cannot access instance variables. We use static methods when we don't need to modify the state of the object but need to perform some operation related to the class. For example, static_method is a static method that can access only class variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Class Method: This is another special type of method that takes cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class that called the method. A class method is also decorated with the @classmethod decorator. A class method can access class variables but cannot access instance variables. We use class methods when we need to perform some operation related to the class, but not necessarily the instance. For example, class_method is a class method that can access only class variables.  \n",

Modules can be used to organize code into logical units, making it easier to manage and reuse code across different programs. A module can define functions, classes, and variables, as well as import other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module in Python, you need to import it into your program using the import statement. The import statement tells Python to load the module and make its contents available in your program. You can import a module as a whole, or you can import specific items from the module using the from ... import ... syntax.\n",

    "When you import a module, Python looks for the module in several locations, including the current directory, the directories specified in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, and the standard library directories. Once the module is found, Python compiles it into bytecode and executes it.\n",

    "You can also create your own modules in Python by defining functions, classes, and variables in a file and then importing the file as a module.

    "Python exceptions are runtime errors that occur when an unexpected event happens during the execution of a Python program. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect user input, logical errors in the code, or unexpected external conditions (such as network failures). Python provides a built-in mechanism for handling exceptions, which allows programmers to gracefully handle errors and take appropriate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a number of built-in exception types that are raised under different circumstances. Some of the common built-in exception types in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "SyntaxError: raised when the Python interpreter encounters a syntax error in the code\n",
    "TypeError: raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type\n",
    "ValueError: raised when a function or method receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: raised when an attempt is made to divide by zero\n",
    "In addition to these built-in exception types, programmers can also define their own custom exception types using the Exception class or one of its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of exception handling in Python is that it allows programmers to gracefully handle runtime errors and prevent their programs from crashing or producing unexpected results. By catching and handling exceptions, programmers can ensure that their programs continue to execute in a predictable and reliable manner, even in the face of unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling can also make it easier to diagnose and fix errors in a program, since it allows programmers to log error messages and stack traces that provide detailed information about where an error occurred and how it can be fixed. This information can be used to identify and fix bugs in a program, or to provide useful feedback to end users who encounter errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to exception handling, logging is another important technique for debugging and maintaining Python programs. Logging allows programmers to record important events and messages during the execution of a program, which can help to identify problems and diagnose errors. Python's built-in logging module provides a flexible and powerful framework for logging messages of varying severity and importance, and for controlling where and how those messages are stored and displayed.\n",

We pass a list of numbers to the map method of the pool along with the function to apply on each element of the list. The map method applies the function to each element of the list in parallel using the worker processes and returns a list of results. Finally, we print the result."
