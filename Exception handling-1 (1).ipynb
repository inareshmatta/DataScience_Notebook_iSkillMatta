    "An exception in Python is a runtime error that occurs during the execution of a program. It is an event that interrupts the normal flow of a program's instructions. In Python, exceptions are objects that represent errors or other exceptional events that can occur during the execution of a program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of exceptions in Python:   \n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in exceptions: These are the exceptions that are provided by the Python language and are built into the interpreter. Examples include ZeroDivisionError, NameError, TypeError, etc.   \n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined exceptions: These are exceptions that are defined by the programmer and are used to signal errors or exceptional events that are specific to the program being developed.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before the program is run, while exceptions occur during the execution of the program.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the syntax of the program is incorrect, such as a missing or extra bracket, a typo in a keyword, etc. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is run and are often easy to fix.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of the program and can be caused by a wide range of factors, including invalid user input, network errors, file I/O errors, and many others. Exceptions are often more difficult to predict and handle than syntax errors, and require more sophisticated error handling techniques.   "
