    "## Probability Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "Probability distribution describes how the values of a random variable are spread or distributed. It provides the likelihood of occurrence of each possible outcome in an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of obtaining a particular value from a continuous random variable. It is denoted as \\(f(x)\\), and the probability of a random variable falling within a particular range is given by the integral of the PDF over that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Probability Distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniform Distribution:**\n",
    "   - All outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "   - Example: Rolling a fair die.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):**\n",
    "   - Bell-shaped curve characterized by mean $(\\mu)$ and standard deviation $(\\sigma)$.\n",
    "   - Many natural phenomena follow this distribution.\n",
    "   - Example: Heights of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "   - Two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "   - Example: Flipping a coin multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Poisson Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "   - Assumes events are rare and independent.\n",
    "   - Example: Number of emails received in an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponential Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.\n",
    "   - Continuous analog to the geometric distribution.\n",
    "   - Example: Time until the next arrival of a bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Gamma Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Generalization of the exponential distribution.\n",
    "   - Used to model the time until \\(k\\) events in a Poisson process.\n",
    "   - Example: Time until \\(k\\) goals are scored in a soccer match.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Chi-Square Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Distribution of the sum of squares of \\(k\\) independent standard normal random variables.\n",
    "   - Used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction.\n",
    "   - Example: Testing the variance of a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Student's t-Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Distribution of a random variable following a normal distribution divided by the square root of a scaled chi-square distribution.\n",
    "   - Used in t-tests for small sample sizes.\n",
    "   - Example: Comparing means of two small samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **F-Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Distribution of the ratio of two independent chi-square random variables.\n",
    "   - Used in analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis.\n",
    "   - Example: Testing the equality of variances in two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these probability distributions is crucial for various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and data science.\n"
