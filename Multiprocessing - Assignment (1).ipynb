    "The main differences between multiprocessing and multithreading are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Model: Multiprocessing creates separate processes that run in parallel, while multithreading creates separate threads within the same process that run concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory: Each process has its own memory space, while all threads within a process share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication: Inter-process communication (IPC) is used for communication between processes, while inter-thread communication (ITC) is used for communication between threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: Multiprocessing is generally faster than multithreading, especially on machines with multiple CPUs or cores. However, it also requires more resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Multiprocessing is more scalable than multithreading, as the number of processes can be increased up to the number of available CPUs or cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Multiprocessing is more complex than multithreading, as it involves creating and managing separate processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation, while multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound tasks that require waiting for external resources such as network or disk I/O"
